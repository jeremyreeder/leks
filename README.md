# LEKS
## Leksikona Esperanta Komandlinia Sercxilo

_LEKS_ is a lexical parser of words of the Esperanto language, implemented as a
command-line Python script. Use it like a dictionary to look up a word. Even if
the word is too complex to exist in a dictionary, LEKS will break it down into
its various parts (separating them with hyphens) and identify the role of each
in the meaning of the word.
