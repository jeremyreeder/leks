# LEKS -- Leksikona Esperanta Komandlinia Sercxilo

_Leks_ is a lexical parser of words of the Esperanto language. Use it like a dictionary to look up a word. Even if the word is too complex to exist in a dictionary, Leks will break it down into its various parts and (coming soon) explain the meaning of each. All standard prefixes, suffixes, and grammatical word endings (excluding verb conjugations) are currently supported. Compound roots are not yet separable.
